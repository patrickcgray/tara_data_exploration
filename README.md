# tara_data_exploration
investigating Tara inline optical data in comparison to satellite based physical features - mainly Gulf Stream

this was initiated at the IOCCG SLS as my primary project and takes Tara data from around the Gulf Stream and investigates the relationship of gamma with physical SST, SSS, and altimetry

I used the pangeo-notebook docker to run this code from 2021-5-15
